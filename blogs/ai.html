            Artificial intelligence has a great impact on every industry as well as on every individual. AI has become
            the core part of the emerging technologies like the Internet of Things, robotics, and data science. Further,
            AI is going to bring more innovations in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence is used in different aspects of our lives starting from face recognition to smart
            cars, it is changing the world. The future is unpredictable, it is very hard to say how the world will look
            like in the next 10 years.However, here are some future perspectives of artificial intellingence.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Impact on Transportation</h2>

        <p>
            Transportation means the movement of passengers and goods from one location to the other. After a lot of
            research and development, the transportation industry is now where it is today. Back in the days, people
            were using animals for transportation. Gradually, everything evolved from bicycle to motorcycles, trains,
            flights, etc. But today the smart vehicles are going to revolutionize the way of our transportation. There
            will be driverless vehicles, good traffic management, fewer carbon emissions, and a reduction in accidents.
            All of these things can be possible due to AI.

        <h2>2. Impact On Heathcare</h2>

        <p>
            The healthcare industry is going to provide a better experience to the patients. Artificial intelligence
            will help to figure out diseases quickly and in advance. This can foster an easy diagnosis and provide
            better treatment to the patients. AI will also speed up the process of discovery of medicines. More
            importantly, some critical diseases like cardiac arrest, brain stroke can be easily detected at an early
            stage and can be treated properly. Apart from this virtual assistant will also provide personalized
            treatment to patients.

        </p>

        <h2>3. Impact on Manufacturing</h2>

        <p>
            There are many applications of AI in the manufacturing industry. It helps to assemble different parts of a
            product and runs the assembly line smoothly with the help of sensors. Most of the repetitive tasks of the
            manufacturing industry got reduced.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Impact on Education</h2>

        <p>
            Education sectors have drastically changed due to AI. Students are now using digital mediums for learning.
            Where AI-based tools can recognize the emotions of the learner. So, this can help the instructor to improve
            the learning experience.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Impact on Marketing Industry</h2>

        <p>
            The marketing industry has greatly impacted by AI. Artificial intelligence in combination with big data is
            improving the way marketing was done earlier. Big corporations like Amazon is now using customer data to
            provide a personal customer profile according to their interest. This has a great impact on the purchase

            are getting better customer support. Chatbots can provide 24/7-hour service to the customers without any
            complaint. In the coming years, chatbots are going to completely handle customer support. AI-based chatbots
            are now able to provide excellent customer support.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <P>
            Finally, Artificial intelligence is now used in many aspects of our lives. In the recent future, it will
            bring more and more productive changes in the future. On the other hand, it has many downsides too, it is
            taking away many jobs and increasing unemployment. No matter it may provide customer support but sometimes
            it canâ€™t connect to the customers emotionally.
